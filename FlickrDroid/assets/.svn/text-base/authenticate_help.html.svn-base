<h2>How to Connect to your Flickr Account</h2>

<p>This screen will allow you to link your Flickr account(s) with {AppName}. In order to do this, you need to log in to Flickr and give {AppName} permission to access your account. You will only need to do this once for each Flickr account you want to access.</p>

<p>Here is what you need to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>When the Authentication screen opens, you should see the Flickr login page in the middle of the screen. Log in to your account.</li>
<li>You will then see a page which asks if you want to allow {AppName} to access your Flickr account. Scroll down until you see the blue button that says "OK, I'LL AUTHORIZE IT". Tap that button.</li>
<li>A new page will load which shows a 9-digit numerical code. Enter this code into the text boxes at the bottom of the screen, and tap the "OK" button.</li>
<li>If authentication is successful, you will be returned to the User screen and your account information will begin loading.</li>
</ol>
